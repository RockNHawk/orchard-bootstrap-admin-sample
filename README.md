## Requirements

This module is dedicated to use with my theme, which currently can't be uploaded to Orchard Gallery, so you won't find it there.
Admin themes are blocked (by some reason) in Gallery, so you need to follow instructions here: [Bootstrap Orchard Admin Theme](https://github.com/yhnavein/orchard-bootstrap-admin-theme).

Generally this is the crucial part:

Go to your **Themes** directory in your Orchard installation and execute below command:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/yhnavein/orchard-bootstrap-admin-theme.git BootstrapAdminTheme
  ```

## Installation

1. Just clone repository to your **Modules** directory in your Orchard installation

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/yhnavein/orchard-bootstrap-admin-sample.git BootstrapAdminSample
  ```

There will be also possibility to download this module simply from Orchard Gallery.

2. Login to your admin panel in your Orchard installation
3. Go to Modules and click **Enable** near to the **Bootstrap Admin Sample** (by default as Uncategorized)
